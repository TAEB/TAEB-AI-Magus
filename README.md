### 杖が魔法使いから学び、魔法使いは杖から学ぶのだ

Magus is a TAEB AI that plays Wizards the way [I](http://alt.org/nethack/player-stats.php?player=Eidolos) do.

He can:

* altar camp for Magicbane
* effectively use an entire wand of wishing, starting with charging
* polypile spellbooks and read them
* use rings of regeneration and conflict tactically
* identify items using scroll and spell, and other tricks (like applying oil)
* use all manner of spell, scroll, ring, and wand
* blank useless potions, scrolls, and spellbooks
* abuse bounce trajectories for magic missile, etc.
* destroy Oracle statues for potential spellbooks
* practice spells for #enhance
* make holy water and bless/uncurse beneficial items using it
* write scroll of identify with a marker
